# x86-to-C Interface Programming Project



Task: Implement a program that converts a grayscale image from float-based representation to integer-based representation using C and x86-64 assembly language.
---

## Input

* `height` (number of rows)
* `width` (number of columns)
* Float pixel values of the grayscale image

## Output

* Integer pixel values (0–255) corresponding to the float values scaled appropriately

---

## Run Program

1. Make sure `build.bat` is in the same directory as the source files.
2. Open **Command Prompt**, navigate to the project folder.
3. Execute the batch file:

   ```cmd
   build.bat
   ```

## Execution Time

Recorded average execution time results in **30 runs** in milliseconds:

| Width | Height | Execution Time (ms) |
| ----- | ------ | ------------------- |
| 10    | 10     |                     |
| 100   | 100    |                     |
| 1000  | 1000   |                     |
